        <p><em>Regional Manager of <a href="https://angieaway.com/2018/10/15/the-office-tour-scranton/">Scranton's</a> </em><strong>Dunder Mufflin branch</strong>
          <br>
          <em>Owner of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condominium_(international_law)">condo</a> in downtown</em>

        <br>
        <p>Michael Gary Scott was born on March 15, 1965 in Scranton, Pennsylvania. He came from a relatively difficult childhood of loneliness. Michael had some trouble with his early education, shown in "Dunder Mifflin Infinity" as Michael tells
          the
          camera crew he was held back from second grade. In "Diversity Day", Michael claims to be of English, Irish, German, and Scottish ancestry. He also claims to be "two-fifteenths" Native American. He has mentioned a stepfather, Jeff, whom he
          despises. In "Nepotism", it is revealed that Michael had a half-sister, from whom he was estranged for 15 years. As a consequence of their reunion, Michael hires his nephew Luke as an intern for the office, but eventually confronts the
          incompetent and rude Luke and ends up spanking him in front of the office, leading Luke to burst into tears and quit.

  <p>Michael found love with Holly Flax (Amy Ryan), Toby's replacement as HR Representative, who appears for a while to be Michael's best chance at love, with the two sharing a similar sense of humor and social awkwardness. However, after David
    Wallace witnesses them kissing, Holly is transferred to the Nashua branch and she and Michael break up after choosing not to pursue a long-distance relationship. Despite the breakup and Holly's new relationship with another man, their affection
    for each other doesn't go away, as it's shown that Holly had been writing a note for Michael on her work computer, as well as their subtle romantic glances at one another during the summer company picnic.</p>

  <h3>Legacy of "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClzJkv3dpY8">That's What She Said</a>"</h3>
  <p>Michael inserts the phrase as a sexually suggestive double entendre even in the most inappropriate circumstances, including business meetings and legal depositions.</p>
